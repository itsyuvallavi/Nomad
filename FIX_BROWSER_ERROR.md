# Fix for layout.js:51 Browser Error

## The Issue
You're seeing: `layout.js:51 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`

This is likely a browser cache issue since our layout.tsx file only has 50 lines and the code is valid.

## Solutions to Try (in order):

### 1. Hard Refresh the Browser
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R`
- **Firefox**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 2. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Open in Incognito/Private Mode
- Chrome: `Cmd + Shift + N`
- Safari: `Cmd + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Cmd + Shift + P`

### 4. Clear Next.js Cache
Run these commands in terminal:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 5. Check Browser Console for More Details
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for the exact file path causing the error
4. Click on the error to see which file and line

## What's Actually Happening
The error refers to `layout.js:51` but:
- Our `layout.tsx` only has 50 lines
- The error is likely in the compiled/bundled JavaScript
- Could be a caching issue or a third-party library

## If Error Persists
1. Check which page you're on when the error occurs
2. Note any specific actions that trigger it
3. Look for the full error stack trace in console

The app should still work despite this error if it's just a cache issue.
