## üü¢ SIMPLE SCENARIOS

### Test 1: Minimal Input - Vague Request

- Then ask: WHEN would you like to travel?
- Then ask: HOW LONG would you like to stay?
- Then ask: WHO is traveling (solo/couple/family)?
- Confirm details before generating

**Obstacles:** User provides absolutely minimal information, forcing maximum questions

**Expected Behavior:**
- AI should recognize Barcelona as destination
- Ask: When would you like to visit Barcelona?

- Ask: Travel style/companions?
- Should NOT assume any dates or duration

**Obstacles:** Single word input that could mean different things

---

## üî¥ COMPLEX SCENARIOS
