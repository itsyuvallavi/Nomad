4. Predictions generated for missing fields
5. Results stored for future learning

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Context Resolution
**Conversation:**
```
User: I'm interested in Paris
Assistant: Paris is beautiful! When would you like to visit?
User: I want to visit there for 5 days
```
**Phase 3 Result:**
- Destination: ✅ Paris (resolved from "there")
- Duration: ✅ 5 days
- Confidence: High

### Example 2: Learning from History
**Search History:**
- "3 days in London from New York"
- "5 days in Paris from New York"
- "Weekend in Rome from New York"

**New Query:** "Weekend trip to Barcelona"
**Phase 3 Enhancement:**
- Suggested origin: New York (learned pattern)
- Default duration: 3 days (weekend pattern)
- Confidence boost from pattern match

### Example 3: Predictive Features
**Input:** "Honeymoon in Bali"
**Predictions:**
- Travelers: 2 (honeymoon = couple)
- Activities: ["romantic dinners", "couples spa", "sunset viewing"]
- Budget: $3750 (luxury destination + honeymoon)
- Duration: 7 days (typical honeymoon length)
