# Testing the Duplicate Trip Fix

## What Was Fixed
We implemented a unique search ID system to prevent duplicate trips from being created when viewing existing trips from the history page.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Create a New Trip
1. Go to http://localhost:9002
2. Enter a search like "3 days in Rome"
3. Let it generate the itinerary
4. The trip should automatically save to your history

### Step 2: View Your History
1. Click on "History" in the navigation
2. You should see your Rome trip listed
3. Note the total number of trips shown

### Step 3: View an Existing Trip (The Critical Test)
1. Click on the Rome trip to view it
2. Notice the URL changes to include `?tripId=[id]&mode=view`
3. The trip should load in view-only mode
4. Check the console for: "Skipping save - viewing existing trip without modifications"

### Step 4: Verify No Duplicate
1. Click back to go to the history page
2. The total number of trips should be THE SAME as before
3. There should be only ONE Rome trip, not two

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ URL includes `tripId` and `mode=view` when viewing from history
- ✅ Console shows "Skipping save - viewing existing trip without modifications"
- ✅ No new trip is created when viewing existing trips
- ✅ Trip count remains the same

### Failure Indicators:
- ❌ Duplicate trips appear in history
- ❌ Console shows "New trip created in Firestore" when viewing
- ❌ Trip count increases when just viewing

## How It Works

1. **Unique IDs**: Each search gets a unique ID when created
2. **Trip Context**: We track whether you're creating, viewing, or editing a trip
3. **Conditional Saving**: 
   - `mode=view`: Never saves (read-only)
   - `mode=edit`: Only saves if modified
   - `mode=create`: Always saves (new trip)

## Additional Tests

### Test Edit Mode (Future Enhancement)
Once we add edit functionality, trips opened in edit mode should:
- Allow modifications
- Only save when changes are made
- Update the existing trip, not create a new one

### Test URL Parameters
- Viewing a trip: `/?tripId=abc123&mode=view`
- Editing a trip: `/?tripId=abc123&mode=edit` (future)
- Creating new: `/` (no parameters)

## Current Status
✅ Basic duplicate prevention implemented
✅ View mode prevents saving
✅ URL-based trip loading
⏳ Edit mode tracking (future enhancement)
⏳ Modified state tracking (future enhancement)
