# File Explanation: `src/components/figma/ThinkingPanel.tsx`

## Summary

This component serves as a visually engaging loading or placeholder screen. It is displayed in the right-hand panel of the `ChatDisplay` component while the application is waiting for the AI to generate the initial itinerary. Its purpose is to provide feedback to the user that a process is running in the background and to give them a sense of what the AI is doing.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Imports

```typescript
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { Loader2, Globe, MapPin, Calendar, DollarSign } from 'lucide-react';
```
- **`framer-motion`**: This library is used extensively to create a dynamic and animated loading experience. Almost every element in this component is animated.
- **`lucide-react`**: Imports various icons that represent different stages of the itinerary planning process (`Globe` for destination, `Calendar` for dates, etc.). `Loader2` is used for the central spinning icon.

### Component Structure and Logic

The component is purely presentational; it doesn't have any complex state or logic. Its main feature is its creative use of `framer-motion` for animations.

```typescript
export function ThinkingPanel() {
  const processingSteps = [
    { icon: Globe, label: "Analyzing destination", delay: 0 },
    // ... more steps
  ];

  return (
    <div className="h-full flex flex-col bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-700 via-slate-800 to-slate-900">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center p-8">
        <div className="text-center max-w-md">
          {/* Main loading animation */}
          {/* ... */}
          {/* Processing steps */}
          {/* ... */}
          {/* Fun facts or tips */}
          {/* ... */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Key Animated Sections

#### 1. Main Loading Animation

```jsx
<motion.div
  className="mb-8 relative"
  animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
  transition={{ duration: 8, repeat: Infinity, ease: "linear" }}
>
  <div className="w-32 h-32 ...">
    <motion.div
      className="w-24 h-24 ..."
      animate={{ scale: [1, 1.1, 1] }}
      transition={{ duration: 2, repeat: Infinity }}
    >
      <Loader2 className="w-12 h-12 text-white animate-spin" />
    </motion.div>
  </div>
</motion.div>
```
- This creates a complex, nested animation:
    - The outer `motion.div` endlessly rotates, creating a celestial-orbit effect.
    - The middle `div` is a static, styled container.
    - The inner `motion.div` endlessly scales up and down, creating a "breathing" or "pulsing" effect.
    - The `Loader2` icon inside uses Tailwind's `animate-spin` utility for a fast, continuous spin.
- The combination of these animations creates a visually interesting and non-static loading state.

#### 2. Processing Steps

```jsx
<div className="space-y-3">
  {processingSteps.map((step, index) => (
    <motion.div
      key={step.label}
      // ... animation props ...
      transition={{ delay: step.delay }}
    >
      <step.icon /* ... */ />
      <span>{step.label}</span>
      <motion.div /* ...blinking dot animation... */ >
        <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-400 rounded-full" />
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  ))}
</div>
```
- **`processingSteps` array**: An array of objects that defines the text, icon, and animation delay for each step. This makes the code clean and easy to modify.
- **`.map()` loop**: It iterates over the `processingSteps` array to render each step.
- **Staggered Animation**: Each step is wrapped in a `motion.div` that animates it sliding in from the left. The `transition={{ delay: step.delay }}` property causes each step to appear one after the other, creating a checklist-like effect.
- **Blinking Dot**: Each step has a small green dot on the right that uses `animate={{ opacity: [0, 1, 0] }}` with `repeat: Infinity` to create a blinking effect, giving the impression of an active process.

#### 3. Fun Fact / Tip

```jsx
<motion.div
  className="mt-8 p-4 bg-slate-800/30 rounded-lg"
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ delay: 1 }}
>
  <p>ðŸ’¡ Did you know? ...</p>
</motion.div>
```
- This final element fades in after a delay. Its purpose is to give the user something to read while they wait, which can make the perceived loading time feel shorter.
