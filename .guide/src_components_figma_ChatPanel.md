# File Explanation: `src/components/figma/ChatPanel.tsx`

## Summary

This file defines a reusable React component, `ChatPanel`, that renders the entire chat interface. This includes the header with the application title, the scrollable message area where the conversation is displayed, and the input area at the bottom for the user to type new messages.

It is a "presentational" component, meaning it is primarily concerned with displaying data and forwarding user interactions (like typing or sending a message) to its parent component (`ChatDisplay`) via props.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Imports

```typescript
import { Settings, Mic, Send } from 'lucide-react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
```
- **`lucide-react`**: Imports icons used in the component, such as `Settings`, `Mic`, and `Send`.
- **`framer-motion`**: This library is used for adding animations to the UI. The component uses it to animate messages appearing, giving the interface a more dynamic and polished feel.

### Interface (`ChatPanelProps`)

```typescript
interface ChatPanelProps {
  messages: Message[];
  inputValue: string;
  onInputChange: (value: string) => void;
  onSendMessage: () => void;
  onKeyPress: (e: React.KeyboardEvent) => void;
  isGenerating: boolean;
  onSettings?: () => void;
}
```
- This TypeScript interface defines the "contract" for the `ChatPanel` component. It lists all the props (properties) that must be passed to it from its parent.
- **`messages`**: An array of message objects to be displayed.
- **`inputValue`**, **`onInputChange`**: The current value of the text input and the function to call when it changes (controlled component pattern).
- **`onSendMessage`**, **`onKeyPress`**: Callback functions to notify the parent when the user sends a message or presses a key.
- **`isGenerating`**: A boolean that tells the component if the AI is currently thinking, so it can display a loading indicator.
- **`onSettings`**: An optional callback for when a settings button is clicked.

### JSX Structure

The component is built with a Flexbox layout (`flex flex-col`) to structure it into three main parts: Header, Messages, and Input Area.

#### 1. Header

```jsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-6 border-b border-slate-600/50">
  {/* ... Logo and Title ... */}
</div>
```
- This `div` creates the top bar of the chat panel. It has a bottom border to visually separate it from the message list. It contains the animated logo and the "Nomad Navigator" title.

#### 2. Messages Area

```jsx
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-6 space-y-6">
  {messages.map((message, index) => (
    <motion.div /* ...animation props... */>
      <div className={`max-w-[80%] ${message.role === 'user' ? 'bg-blue-600 ...' : 'bg-slate-700 ...'}`}>
        <p>{message.content}</p>
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  ))}
  {isGenerating && ( /* ...loading indicator... */ )}
</div>
```
- **`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`**: These Tailwind classes are key. `flex-1` makes this `div` take up all available vertical space, and `overflow-y-auto` makes it scrollable if the content exceeds the available height.
- **`messages.map(...)`**: This is standard React for rendering a list. It iterates over the `messages` array passed in via props.
- **Conditional Styling**: Inside the loop, it checks `message.role`. If the role is 'user', it applies styles to align the message to the right with a blue background. If the role is 'assistant', it aligns to the left with a gray background.
- **`motion.div`**: Each message is wrapped in this component from `framer-motion`. The props `initial`, `animate`, and `transition` are used to make each message fade in and slide up smoothly as it's added to the list.
- **Loading Indicator**: The `{isGenerating && ...}` block conditionally renders a "thinking" bubble (three animated dots) whenever the `isGenerating` prop is `true`.

#### 3. Input Area

```jsx
<div className="p-6 border-t border-slate-600/50">
  <div className="bg-slate-700/80 ... flex items-center gap-3">
    <input /* ...props... */ />
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <button><Mic /></button>
      <button><Send /></button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p className="text-slate-500 text-xs text-center mt-4">
    Nomad Navigator may contain errors...
  </p>
</div>
```
- This `div` is the footer of the panel, with a top border for separation.
- It contains the styled `input` field. The `value`, `onChange`, `onKeyPress`, and `disabled` attributes are all bound to the props passed from the parent component. This makes it a "controlled component."
- It includes buttons for microphone and sending the message. The send button is disabled based on the `isGenerating` prop and whether the input has any text.
- Finally, it includes the small-print disclaimer at the very bottom.
