# Mobile Responsiveness Implementation Plan

## Objective
Make Nomad Navigator fully responsive for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.

## Current Issues
1. Split-panel layout (chat/itinerary) doesn't work on mobile
2. Buttons and inputs not optimized for touch
3. No mobile navigation pattern
4. Images and content overflow on small screens

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Identify all components that need mobile optimization
- Test current layout on various screen sizes
- Determine breakpoint strategy

### Phase 2: Core Layout Changes
1. **Main Container (`chat-container.tsx`)**
   - Convert grid layout to responsive
   - Implement tab/swipe navigation for mobile
   - Add mobile-specific navigation controls

2. **Chat Panel (`chat-interface.tsx`)**
   - Optimize message display for mobile
   - Fix input area for mobile keyboards
   - Ensure proper scrolling behavior

3. **Itinerary View (`itinerary-view.tsx`)**
   - Stack destination cards vertically on mobile
   - Optimize activity cards for touch
   - Ensure images are responsive

4. **Forms (`trip-search-form.tsx`, `trip-details-form.tsx`)**
   - Optimize input sizes for touch
   - Improve button tap targets (min 44px)
   - Fix spacing and padding

### Phase 3: Navigation Pattern
- Implement bottom tab navigation for mobile
- Add swipe gestures between chat/itinerary
- Create mobile-specific header

### Technical Approach
1. Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
2. Create mobile-first styles
3. Add touch-specific interactions
4. Implement viewport meta tag optimization
5. Test on real devices/emulators

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px (sm)
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px (md)
- Desktop: > 1024px (lg)
