# Progressive UI Implementation Complete

## What Was Fixed
The UI was waiting for the entire itinerary to complete before showing anything. Now it builds the itinerary step-by-step as each city is generated.

## How It Works Now

### Step-by-Step Building
1. **Metadata Phase (40%)**
   - Shows trip title, dates, cost immediately
   - Empty itinerary container ready to receive days

2. **City Generation (40-90%)**
   - As each city completes, its days are added to the display
   - London days appear first (7 days)
   - Brussels days appear next (6 days)
   - User sees the itinerary building in real-time

3. **Completion (100%)**
   - Final itinerary with all days sorted by date

### Key Changes Made

#### New State Management
```typescript
// Track partial building
const [partialItinerary, setPartialItinerary] = useState<any>(null);
const [generationMetadata, setGenerationMetadata] = useState<any>(null);
```

#### Progressive Updates in Polling
```typescript
if (progress.status === 'metadata_ready') {
    // Initialize with metadata only
    const initialItinerary = {
        title: metadata.title,
        itinerary: [], // Empty, will fill progressively
        cost: metadata.estimatedCost
    };
    setCurrentItinerary(initialItinerary);
}

if (progress.status === 'city_complete') {
    // Add this city's days to existing itinerary
    const updatedItinerary = {
        ...partialItinerary,
        itinerary: [
            ...partialItinerary.itinerary,
            ...newCityDays
        ].sort((a, b) => a.day - b.day)
    };
    setCurrentItinerary(updatedItinerary);
}
```

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- User submits: "2 weeks to London and Brussels"
- Loading spinner for 70+ seconds
- Nothing visible until completely done
- User unsure if it's working

### After
- User submits: "2 weeks to London and Brussels"
- 5 seconds: Trip overview appears (title, dates, cost)
- 35 seconds: London days 1-7 appear
- 70 seconds: Brussels days 8-13 appear
- User sees progress throughout

## Testing
Run `npx tsx scripts/test-ui-progressive.ts` to verify:
- Metadata loads first
- Each city adds its days progressively
- Final itinerary has all days sorted correctly

## Benefits
1. **Better UX** - Users see progress, not just a spinner
2. **Faster perceived performance** - Something visible in 5 seconds vs 70
3. **Transparent process** - Users understand what's happening
4. **Graceful partial results** - If Brussels fails, at least London is shown
