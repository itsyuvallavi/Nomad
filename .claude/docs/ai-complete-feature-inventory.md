- **Location**: Referenced in `openai-travel-prompts.ts`
- **Keep**: NO - Replace with OSM
- **Action**: Will be superseded by OSM integration

### üîÑ Features to Enhance

#### 1. **Logical Daily Planning** (Your requirement)
- **Current**: Basic zone planning exists
- **Enhancement Needed**:
  ```
  - Each day stays in same area/neighborhood
  - No 30+ min detours just to return
  - Activities flow naturally (breakfast ‚Üí morning ‚Üí lunch ‚Üí afternoon ‚Üí dinner)
  - Walking distance between consecutive activities
  - Consider opening hours (museums closed Mondays, etc.)
  ```
- **Implementation**: Strengthen in prompts + validation

#### 2. **OSM Integration** (Your new requirement)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Real POI data
- **Features to add**:
  ```
  - Query real restaurants, hotels, museums, parks
  - Get accurate coordinates
  - Opening hours
  - User ratings
  - Walking/driving distances
  - Nearby alternatives
  ```

### ‚ùå Features to Remove

1. **Default Destinations** (London, Paris fallbacks)
2. **Default Dates** (tomorrow, next week)
3. **Default Durations** (3 days)
4. **Fallback Itineraries**
5. **Venue Knowledge Base** (replace with OSM)

### üìä Feature Priority for Simplified Architecture

#### Phase 1: Core (Must Have)
1. Conversational flow
2. No defaults
3. Zone-based planning
4. Route optimization
5. Location enrichment
6. Modification support

#### Phase 2: Enhanced (Should Have)
1. Cost estimation
2. Stronger logical daily planning
3. OSM integration
4. Weather (if API available)

#### Phase 3: Nice to Have
1. Multi-city trips
2. Transportation booking
3. Restaurant reservations
4. Activity tickets

### üéØ Key Requirements Summary
