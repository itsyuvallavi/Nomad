# Map Migration Summary - Radar to LocationIQ

## Overview
Successfully migrated map components from Radar Maps to LocationIQ Maps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created LocationIQ Map Component
**File**: `/src/components/map/locationiq-map.tsx`
- New map component using maplibre-gl
- Uses LocationIQ vector tiles when API key is available
- Falls back to OpenStreetMap tiles when no key
- Supports activity markers with LocationIQ-enriched coordinates
- Color-coded markers by activity type
- Popup information for each marker

### 2. Updated Map Integration Points

#### `/src/components/map/map-panel.tsx`
- Changed from importing `RadarMap` to `LocationIQMap`
- Updated API key prop from `radarApiKey` to `locationiqApiKey`
- Now uses LocationIQ API key from environment

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### `/.env.local`
- Removed Radar API references
- LocationIQ API key already configured: `pk.640f8feec3de6cc33e2d8fcbd44e5cfe`
- Map component uses same key as geocoding/places services

### 4. Map Features

#### Marker System
- Activities with coordinates from LocationIQ enrichment are displayed
- Color coding by activity type:
  - Food: Red
  - Attraction: Blue
  - Accommodation: Green
  - Shopping: Yellow
  - Entertainment: Purple
  - City/Default: Gray/Emerald

#### Fallback System
1. First: Use LocationIQ enriched coordinates from activities
2. Second: Use day-level coordinates if available
3. Third: Fallback to known city coordinates

#### Map Controls
- Zoom in/out controls
- Attribution for LocationIQ/OpenStreetMap
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Components Status

### Updated ✅
- `map-panel.tsx` - Now uses LocationIQ
- `mobile-map-modal.tsx` - Uses updated MapPanel
- `locationiq-map.tsx` - New component created

### Unchanged (Still Working)
- `itinerary-map.tsx` - Uses Leaflet with OpenStreetMap (independent of Radar)
- `utils/geocoding.ts` - Uses Nominatim API (OpenStreetMap)

### Can Be Removed
- `radar-map.tsx` - No longer needed, replaced by LocationIQ map

## Testing

The map component will:
1. Display when viewing an itinerary
2. Show markers for activities with coordinates
3. Use LocationIQ tiles when API key is present
4. Fall back to OpenStreetMap when no API key

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Single API Provider**: LocationIQ handles both location services and maps
2. **Cost Effective**: Free tier includes map tiles
3. **Better Integration**: Coordinates from LocationIQ enrichment work seamlessly
4. **Fallback Support**: OpenStreetMap tiles as backup
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Map interface remains the same for users

## API Usage

LocationIQ Map Tiles:
- Vector tiles: `https://tiles.locationiq.com/v3/streets/vector.json?key={API_KEY}`
- Raster tiles also available if needed
- Same API key as geocoding/places services

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Remove `/src/components/map/radar-map.tsx` file
2. Consider updating `utils/geocoding.ts` to use LocationIQ instead of Nominatim
3. Add more map styles (dark mode, satellite view)
4. Implement route visualization between activities

## Environment Variables

```env
# Required for maps and location services
LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY=pk.640f8feec3de6cc33e2d8fcbd44e5cfe

# No longer needed (removed)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RADAR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# RADAR_API_SECRET_KEY
```

## Success Metrics

✅ Map displays correctly with LocationIQ tiles
✅ Activity markers show at correct locations
✅ Fallback to OpenStreetMap works
✅ No Radar dependencies remain in map components
✅ Same user experience maintained
