# Session Summary - September 20, 2025

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed Major AI Performance Issues
**Problem**: AI system had only 38.9% success rate with 22.5s average response time
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Switched from GPT-5 `responses.create()` (60+ second timeouts) to GPT-3.5-turbo-16k `chat.completions.create()` (5-6 seconds)
- Replaced OSM enrichment (30-60 seconds for 50-100 API calls) with HERE Places API (350ms batch searches)
- Fixed date extraction patterns for "next week", "monday next week", etc.
- Enhanced prompts to ensure 5-6 activities per day (was only generating 1)
- Fixed JSON parsing errors by removing comments and implementing multi-pass repair

### 2. Fixed Date Display Issue (Partially)
**Problem**: Dates showing one day before requested (Sept 25 requested, Sept 24 shown)
**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed timezone issue in UI components by parsing dates in local timezone instead of UTC
- Modified: `ItineraryDisplay.tsx`, `DayTimeline.tsx`, `Export-menu.tsx`
- Used `new Date(year, month-1, day)` instead of `new Date(dateString)`
- **ISSUE**: Fix works but returns after hard reset - needs investigation

### 3. Fixed Build Errors
**Problem**: Build failing with AuthProvider SSR errors
**Solution**: Added conditional imports for SSR compatibility in `HomePage.tsx` and `ItineraryPage.tsx`

### 4. Added Comprehensive Logging
**Implemented detailed logging in**:
- `/src/app/api/ai/route.ts` - Full request/response logging
- `/src/services/ai/ai-controller.ts` - Pattern extraction details
- `/src/services/ai/trip-generator.ts` - Generation step timing

**Logs now show**:
- Exact user input and timing
- Intent extraction details (pattern matching vs GPT-5)
- Generation phases with timing
- Complete response summaries

### 5. Created AI Refactoring Plan
**Document**: `/home/user/studio/docs/ai-refactoring-plan.md`
- Plan to split 1000+ line files into manageable modules
- `ai-controller.ts` → 5 files (controller, intent-extractor, date-parser, conversation-manager, cache-manager)
- `trip-generator.ts` → 6 files (generator, builder, optimizer, enricher, estimator, validator)

## Current State of Key Files

### Modified Files (Working):
- `/src/services/ai/ai-controller.ts` - Pattern matching for dates, GPT-3.5 integration
- `/src/services/ai/trip-generator.ts` - HERE Places enrichment, proper date calculation
- `/src/services/api/here-places.ts` - Batch search, city filtering
- `/src/app/api/ai/route.ts` - Comprehensive logging, error handling
- `/src/components/itinerary-components/itinerary/ItineraryDisplay.tsx` - Local timezone parsing
- `/src/components/itinerary-components/itinerary/DayTimeline.tsx` - Local timezone parsing

### Test Results:
- Intent extraction: ~100ms for simple cases (pattern matching)
- Itinerary generation: 5-6 seconds total (was 30-60 seconds)
- HERE enrichment: 286ms for batch searches

## Outstanding Issues to Address

### 1. Date Off-by-One Bug (CRITICAL)
- **Symptom**: After hard reset, dates show one day before requested again
- **Where to investigate**:
  - Check if date parsing fix is being cached incorrectly
  - Verify the fix is applied to all date display components
  - May need to check service worker or browser caching
- **Important Note**: System date is September 20, 2025

### 2. Wrong Country Venues (MINOR)
- Occasionally still getting venues from wrong countries despite city filtering
- HERE API searches need stronger location context

### 3. Deployment Needed
- All fixes are ready but need production deployment
- Build succeeds locally

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix the persistent date issue**:
   - Debug why the date fix reverts after hard reset
   - Check all components that parse/display dates
   - Ensure consistent date handling throughout

2. **Deploy to production**:
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy to Firebase hosting
   - Verify fixes work in production

3. **Implement AI refactoring** (after deployment):
   - Start with Phase 1: Extract date parser
   - Follow the plan in `/docs/ai-refactoring-plan.md`
   - Test thoroughly after each phase

## Key Environment Variables Required
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
HERE_API_KEY=... (for venue enrichment)
```

## Commands to Know
```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run dev           # Dev server (port 9002)
npx tsx scripts/test-ai-direct.ts  # Test AI extraction
```

## Important Context for Next Session
1. HERE Places API is primary venue service (fast, free tier)
2. OSM and LocationIQ are fallbacks only (slow but free)
3. GPT-3.5-turbo-16k is used for generation (not GPT-5)
4. Date parsing happens in both backend (AI) and frontend (display)
5. The date issue is specifically in the UI display layer, not AI extraction
6. Today's date is September 20, 2025

## Files to Check First Next Time
1. Components that display dates (may have missed some)
2. Service worker or caching that might preserve old code
3. Any date formatting utilities in `/src/lib/utils/`
4. Check if AI controller is using correct "today" date

## TODO List Status
- [ ] Fix date-off-by-one error in UI (returns after hard reset)
- [ ] Implement AI refactoring plan
- [ ] Deploy all fixes to production

*Session ended with date display issue returning after hard reset - this should be the first priority to investigate next session.*
