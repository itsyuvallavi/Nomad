# Session Summary - September 20, 2025 (Updated January 20, 2025)

## Previous Session (September 20, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Major AI Performance Issues
**Problem**: AI system had only 38.9% success rate with 22.5s average response time
**Solutions Implemented**:
- Switched from GPT-5 `responses.create()` (60+ second timeouts) to GPT-3.5-turbo-16k `chat.completions.create()` (5-6 seconds)
- Replaced OSM enrichment (30-60 seconds for 50-100 API calls) with HERE Places API (350ms batch searches)
- Fixed date extraction patterns for "next week", "monday next week", etc.
- Enhanced prompts to ensure 5-6 activities per day (was only generating 1)
- Fixed JSON parsing errors by removing comments and implementing multi-pass repair

### 2. Fixed Date Display Issue (Partially)
**Problem**: Dates showing one day before requested (Sept 25 requested, Sept 24 shown)
**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed timezone issue in UI components by parsing dates in local timezone instead of UTC
- Modified: `ItineraryDisplay.tsx`, `DayTimeline.tsx`, `Export-menu.tsx`
- Used `new Date(year, month-1, day)` instead of `new Date(dateString)`
- **ISSUE**: Fix works but returns after hard reset - needs investigation

## Today's Session (January 20, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Conversation Context Persistence
**Problem**: AI not storing information from the conversation between messages
**Solution**:
- Added localStorage persistence in `ItineraryPage.tsx` with key `conversation-context-${searchId}`
- Context automatically saved on every update and restored on page refresh
- Added SSR safety checks with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
- Limited conversation history to 20 messages to prevent token overflow

### 2. Fixed Venue Address Accuracy
**Problem**: Some addresses showing venues from wrong countries
**Solutions**:
- Added English language parameter (`lang: 'en-US'`) to HERE API calls
- Implemented distance-based filtering using Haversine formula
- Filter out venues > 30km from city center coordinates
- Added city bounding box validation

### 3. Fixed Cost Estimate Display
**Problem**: Trip cost not showing even though calculated
**Solution**:
- Fixed `addCostEstimates` method in `trip-generator.ts` to actually attach cost data to itinerary
- Cost object now properly includes: total, flights, accommodation, dailyExpenses, currency

### 4. Implemented Multi-City Trip Support
**Problem**: Adding a new destination was replacing the entire itinerary
**Solutions**:
- Added extension detection for phrases like "add X days in", "extend trip", "after the trip"
- Implemented destination combining logic with deduplication
- Duration now adds up instead of replacing
- Enhanced prompt builder to properly allocate days per city
- Fixed duplicate destination bug using Set-based deduplication

### 5. Performance Optimizations
**Problems & Solutions**:
- **Excessive logging**: Fixed infinite re-render in `ItineraryDisplay.tsx` by correcting useEffect dependencies
- **Timeout errors**: Increased timeout from 25s to 45s for complex multi-city trips
- **Token limits**: Increased from 4000 to 6000 for multi-city generations

### 6. Migrated to GPT-4o-mini
**Changes**:
- Updated all references from GPT-3.5-turbo-16k to gpt-4o-mini
- Converted deprecated GPT-5 API calls to chat completions API
- Adjusted token limits and parameters for new model

## Current State of Key Files

### Modified Files (Working):
- `/src/services/ai/ai-controller.ts` - Pattern matching for dates, GPT-3.5 integration
- `/src/services/ai/trip-generator.ts` - HERE Places enrichment, proper date calculation
- `/src/services/api/here-places.ts` - Batch search, city filtering
- `/src/app/api/ai/route.ts` - Comprehensive logging, error handling
- `/src/components/itinerary-components/itinerary/ItineraryDisplay.tsx` - Local timezone parsing
- `/src/components/itinerary-components/itinerary/DayTimeline.tsx` - Local timezone parsing

### Test Results:
- Intent extraction: ~100ms for simple cases (pattern matching)
- Itinerary generation: 5-6 seconds total (was 30-60 seconds)
- HERE enrichment: 286ms for batch searches

## Outstanding Issues to Address

### 1. Date Off-by-One Bug (RESOLVED TODAY)
- **Previous Issue**: After hard reset, dates show one day before requested
- **Status**: Fixed by ensuring consistent local timezone parsing across all components
- **Important Note**: System date verification shows correct dates now

### 2. Wrong Country Venues (RESOLVED TODAY)
- **Previous Issue**: Venues from wrong countries
- **Status**: Fixed with distance-based filtering and English language parameter

### 3. Multi-City Day Allocation
- **Current Issue**: Need to verify proper day distribution in complex multi-city trips
- **To Test**: Trips with 3+ cities and uneven day counts

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test Multi-City Trip Generation**:
   - Verify proper day allocation for 3+ city trips
   - Test edge cases like 7 days across 3 cities
   - Ensure city toggle navigation works smoothly

2. **Deploy to production**:
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy to Firebase hosting
   - Verify all fixes work in production environment

3. **Implement AI refactoring** (after deployment):
   - Start with Phase 1: Extract date parser
   - Follow the plan in `/docs/ai-refactoring-plan.md`
   - Test thoroughly after each phase

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor GPT-4o-mini response times
   - Track multi-city generation success rates
   - Watch for timeout issues on complex queries

## Key Environment Variables Required
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
HERE_API_KEY=... (for venue enrichment)
```

## Commands to Know
```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run dev           # Dev server (port 9002)
npx tsx scripts/test-ai-direct.ts  # Test AI extraction
```

## Important Context for Next Session
1. HERE Places API is primary venue service (fast, free tier, with distance filtering)
2. OSM and LocationIQ are fallbacks only (slow but free)
3. **GPT-4o-mini** is now used for generation (migrated from GPT-3.5-turbo-16k today)
4. Date parsing happens in both backend (AI) and frontend (display) - both fixed
5. Conversation context persists via localStorage with searchId key
6. Multi-city trips now properly combine destinations and sum durations

## Key Files Modified Today
1. `/src/pages/itinerary/ItineraryPage.tsx` - Added localStorage persistence
2. `/src/services/ai/ai-controller.ts` - Multi-city extension detection, GPT-4o-mini
3. `/src/services/ai/trip-generator.ts` - Cost attachment fix, distance filtering
4. `/src/services/api/here-places.ts` - English language parameter
5. `/src/services/ai/prompts.ts` - Multi-city day distribution logic
6. `/src/components/itinerary-components/itinerary/ItineraryDisplay.tsx` - Fixed re-render loop
