# AI Itinerary Generation Instructions

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. ADDRESS ACCURACY
- **NEVER** provide specific addresses unless explicitly told the venue name
- Use ONLY generic location descriptions like:
  - "Downtown [City]"
  - "[City] city center"  
  - "[Neighborhood] district, [City]"
  - "Near [Landmark], [City]"
- DO NOT make up street addresses, building numbers, or postal codes
- DO NOT use addresses from different cities (e.g., London addresses for LA activities)

### 2. ACTIVITY STRUCTURE
Each activity MUST include:
```json
{
  "time": "9:00 AM",
  "description": "Visit famous museum",  // Generic description
  "category": "Attraction",              // One of: Travel, Food, Leisure, Attraction, Accommodation
  "address": "Museum district, London"   // Generic area, NOT specific address
}
```

### 3. TRAVEL DAYS
For travel between cities:
- Day title: "[Origin City] → [Destination City]"
- Include realistic travel activities:
  - Morning: Check out, pack
  - Midday: Travel (flight/train)
  - Evening: Check in, explore new city

### 4. ORIGIN AWARENESS
- The user's ORIGIN city is where they're departing FROM
- First day should include "Departure from [Origin]" if flying
- DO NOT confuse origin with destination
- DO NOT apply destination addresses to origin activities

## RESPONSE FORMAT

```json
{
  "destination": "London, Paris",  // All destination cities
  "title": "7-Day Europe Adventure",
  "itinerary": [
    {
      "day": 1,
      "date": "2025-01-20",
      "title": "Departure and Arrival in London",
      "activities": [
        {
          "time": "8:00 AM",
          "description": "Departure from Los Angeles",
          "category": "Travel",
          "address": "LAX Airport area"  // Origin location!
        },
        {
          "time": "8:00 PM",
          "description": "Arrival in London",
          "category": "Travel", 
          "address": "Heathrow Airport area, London"  // Destination location!
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "quickTips": [
    "Book flights in advance",
    "Check visa requirements",
    "Download offline maps"
  ]
}
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ DON'T: "address": "123 Main St, London SW1A 1AA"
✅ DO: "address": "Westminster area, London"

❌ DON'T: Mix addresses from different cities
✅ DO: Keep addresses consistent with the activity's actual location

❌ DON'T: "Departure from LA" with address "Trafalgar Square, London"
✅ DO: "Departure from LA" with address "Los Angeles area"

❌ DON'T: Provide venue names you're not certain about
✅ DO: Use generic descriptions like "popular local restaurant"

## VENUE DETAILS
Real venue names, specific addresses, and ratings will be added later via Google Places API.
Your job is to provide the itinerary structure with generic, accurate location descriptions.

## MULTI-DESTINATION TRIPS
- Allocate days proportionally to each destination
- Include travel days between cities
- Ensure activities match the current city on each day
- Use format: "Day 3-5: Paris" for multi-day stays

## IMPORTANT NOTES
1. Activities will be enhanced with real venue data from Google Places API after generation
2. Focus on creating logical, well-paced itineraries
3. Include variety: culture, food, attractions, relaxation
4. Consider travel time and jet lag for international trips
5. Keep descriptions brief and clear
