# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Nomad Navigator - AI-powered travel planning application for digital nomads using Next.js 15, Firebase Genkit, and Google Gemini AI.

## Plan & Review

### Before starting work
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Always in plan mode to make a plan
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†After get the plan, make sure you Write the plan to .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The plan should be a detailed implementation plan and the reasoning behind them, as well as tasks broken down.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†If the task require external knowledge or certain package, also research to get latest knowledge (Use Task tool for research)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Don't over plan it, always think MVP.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Once you write the plan, firstly ask me to review it. Do not continue until I approve the plan.

### While implementing
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†You should update the plan as you work.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†After you complete tasks in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes you made, so following tasks can be easily hand over to other engineers.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†After you complete the task, you should update the plan to mark the task as completed.

## AI Testing & Consistency Guidelines

### CRITICAL: Always Test Before Deploying

**Before making any changes to AI prompts or logic, you MUST:**

1. **Run baseline test**: `npm run test:ai --baseline`
2. **If baseline fails**: DO NOT proceed with complex changes
3. **After any prompt changes**: Run full test suite with `npm run test:ai`

### Testing Strategy

#### Regression Prevention
- The "3 days in London" test is our **golden standard**
- If this simple request breaks, something is fundamentally wrong
- Never deploy if baseline test fails

#### Test Cases Priority
1. **Simple requests** (London, Paris weekend) - must ALWAYS work
2. **Medium complexity** (multi-city trips) - should work consistently  
3. **Complex requests** (multi-week, constrained) - can have occasional issues

#### When Making Changes to AI Flows

**WORKFLOW:**
```bash
# 1. Before any changes
npm run test:ai --baseline

# 2. Make your prompt/logic changes in src/ai/flows/

# 3. Test immediately after changes
npm run test:ai --baseline

# 4. If baseline passes, run full suite
npm run test:ai

# 5. Only deploy if all simple tests pass
```

### Monitoring Rules

#### Daily Checks
- Run `npm run test:ai` at least once per day during active development
- Check `ai-test-results.json` for trends and regressions

#### Red Flags üö®
- Simple tests failing after working previously
- Response times increasing dramatically
- Missing required fields in responses
- Inconsistent destination/day counts
- Genkit flows returning malformed schemas

#### Response Quality Metrics
- **Response Time**: Should be < 10 seconds for simple requests
- **Structure Validation**: All required fields present (see `src/ai/schemas.ts`)
- **Logical Consistency**: Days/destinations match request
- **Activity Count**: Reasonable number of activities per day

### Debugging Failed Tests

When tests fail:

1. **Check the last working version** - what changed in AI flows?
2. **Isolate the issue** - test with fresh conversation context
3. **Validate your test case** - is the expected structure correct?
4. **Check for prompt pollution** - are complex prompts affecting simple ones?
5. **Use Genkit UI** - `npm run genkit:dev` to debug individual flows

### Integration with Development

#### Before Code Reviews
- Include test results in your PR description
- Show baseline test passes
- Document any test changes and why

#### Before Deployments
- Full test suite must pass
- No regressions in simple test cases
- Response times within acceptable range

### MCP Integration

When adding new MCPs:
1. Run baseline test before adding MCP
2. Add MCP and test again
3. Ensure MCP doesn't break existing functionality
4. Update test cases if MCP changes expected behavior

#### Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Run just the critical baseline test
npm run test:ai --baseline

# Run all tests
npm run test:ai

# View test history
cat ai-test-results.json | jq '.[-5:]'  # Last 5 results
```

**Remember**: AI development is like traditional software development - test early, test often, and never deploy broken code!

## Development Workflow

### Planning Requirements
- Always use plan mode before starting implementation work
- Write detailed plans to `.claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md` including reasoning and task breakdown
- Research external knowledge/packages if needed (use Task tool)
- Focus on MVP approach - don't over-plan
- Get user approval before implementation

### During Implementation
- Update the plan file as you work
- Document changes with detailed descriptions for handover
- Mark tasks as completed in the plan

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development servers
npm run dev                # Next.js dev server with Turbopack (default port 9002)
npm run dev:both          # Run both Next.js and Genkit servers in parallel
npm run genkit:dev        # Firebase Genkit UI for testing AI flows
npm run genkit:watch      # Genkit with hot reload

# Code quality
npm run typecheck         # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint              # ESLint code linting

# AI Testing (NEW)
npm run test:ai           # Run full AI consistency test suite
npm run test:ai --baseline # Run just the baseline London test

# Production
npm run build             # Production build
npm run start             # Start production server
```

## Architecture Overview

### AI Flow System
The application uses Firebase Genkit with Google Gemini for all AI processing:

**Core Files:**
- `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Genkit configuration with Gemini model setup
- `src/ai/schemas.ts`: Zod schemas for structured AI outputs
- `src/ai/flows/`: AI processing flows (server actions)
  - `analyze-initial-prompt.ts`: Analyzes user input to identify missing trip information
  - `generate-personalized-itinerary.ts`: Creates detailed day-by-day itineraries
  - `refine-itinerary-based-on-feedback.ts`: Modifies itineraries based on user feedback

**AI Flow Implementation Pattern:**
Each flow follows this structure:
1. Input/Output schemas using Zod
2. Flow definition with `ai.defineFlow()`
3. Prompt template with tool usage
4. Export as Next.js server action

**Tool Usage in AI Flows:**
The AI uses three custom tools defined in `generate-personalized-itinerary.ts`:
- `estimateFlightTime`: Calculates flight durations between cities
- `getWeatherForecast`: Fetches real weather data (requires OPENWEATHERMAP API key)
- `findRealPlaces`: Searches for real venues via Foursquare API (requires FOURSQUARE_API_KEY)

### Application State Flow
The main app (`src/app/page.tsx`) manages state transitions between views:
- **StartItinerary** ‚Üí **ChatDisplay** ‚Üí **ItineraryDisplay**
- State passed via props, not global state management
- Recent searches stored in localStorage

### External API Integration
Located in `src/lib/api/`:
- **Foursquare API** (`foursquare.ts`): Real venue search
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (`weather.ts`): Weather forecasts
- **API Validation** (`api-validation.ts`): Key validation utilities

### Component Structure
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (auto-generated, don't modify)
- `src/components/`: Feature components
  - `start-itinerary.tsx`: Initial form and recent searches
  - `chat-display.tsx`: AI conversation interface
  - `itinerary-display.tsx`: Generated itinerary view
  - `itinerary-form.tsx`: Trip details input form

## Environment Variables
Required in `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=           # Google AI API key (required)
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=       # Foursquare Places API (optional, for real venues)
OPENWEATHERMAP=           # OpenWeatherMap API key (optional, for weather)
```

## Key Technical Patterns

### Date Handling
AI flows use current year by default. Date extraction logic in `generate-personalized-itinerary.ts:289-299` ensures correct date formatting.

### Error Handling
AI flows include fallback responses when APIs fail. See `generate-personalized-itinerary.ts:403-437` for error recovery pattern.

### Information Gathering Strategy
Defined in `analyze-initial-prompt.ts:49-86`:

**Essential Information (AI will ask if missing):**
- Trip duration/length (e.g., "5 days", "2 weeks")
- Travel dates (specific or flexible like "mid-January")
- Destination(s)
- Origin/departure location
- Number of travelers

**Smart Defaults (AI won't ask - applies automatically):**
- Budget: Moderate ($150-200/day per person)
- Activities: Mix of highlights, culture, food, sights
- Travel style: Balanced comfort/adventure
- Accommodation: Mid-range hotels/Airbnbs

When modifying AI functionality:
1. Update relevant flow in `src/ai/flows/`
2. Ensure schema compliance in `src/ai/schemas.ts`
3. Test using `npm run genkit:dev` to access the Genkit UI
4. **RUN AI TESTS**: `npm run test:ai --baseline` before and after changes
5. Keep questions minimal - only ask for essential missing info
